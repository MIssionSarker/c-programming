/*initialization: This is where you initialize the loop control variable(s). It is usually a variable declaration and assignment statement. For example, int i = 0;.

condition: This is the condition that must be true for the loop to continue executing. If the condition is false, the loop will terminate. For example, i < 10.

increment/decrement: This is where you increment or decrement the loop control variable(s) after each iteration of the loop. This is also known as the "update statement". For example, i++ or i = i - 1.*/
